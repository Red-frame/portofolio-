ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm **Jahir Fiquitiva** a full-stack software engineer from [Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colombia/@4,-72z/) with over five (5) years of professional experience.

I focus on details and I'm passionate about crafting software products that look great and are both accessible and easy to maintain.

I'm a big fan of open source and have shared a lot of my work, including websites, libraries, and applications, on GitHub. I've received and made various pull requests and engaged with the community to merge our work upstream. In fact, my projects have over 1.5K stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva)!

I'm a proactive and adaptive worker and learner, and I enjoy being part of globally-remote teams where people are the focus and values like trust, kindness, and inclusion are important. I'm always up for a challenge where I can improve and expand my skillset. That's why I work on [side projects](/projects) in my spare time and contribute to open source when possible.

<h3>More</h3>

I first discovered my passion for software development while doing some programming for a couple of robotics projects during pre-college. I started by exploring Android development, gaining a deeper understanding of programming principles. Later, I became interested in building full-stack JavaScript web applications, honing my skills in front-end and back-end development.

When I'm not coding, I like to watch TV shows and movies, play video games with friends or hang out with them or my family. I'm always [listening to music](/dashboard) so check out the website footer to see what I'm currently jamming to.

If you're curious about the hardware and software tools I use every day and help me get the job done, feel free to check out the [`uses`](/uses) page.

My pronouns are he/they, and you can pronounce my name `Ja-eer` `Fee-kit-eva` (the h in my first name is silent). Learn even more about me at my [timeline](https://timeline.jahir.dev/).

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope you have a great day!
