I strive to build great products and many of them are [open source](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva). But this wouldn't be possible without the support of my [sponsors](#thanks)!

If you use any of my projects, please consider donating so that I can continue maintaining them.

<Heading $as={'h2'} className={'text-xl'}>Why donate?</Heading>

Since 2015, I've been making three open-source Android dashboards: [Blueprint](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/blueprint), [Frames](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/frames) and [Kuper](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/kuper).

They have helped countless designers create hundreds – if not thousands – of apps and publish them on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Jahir%20Fiquitiva&c=apps).

I also make some of my personal [projects](/projects) public, including Android apps, web apps, services, and bots.
